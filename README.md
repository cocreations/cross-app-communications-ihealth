# Cross App Communications
# (+ iHealth CONNECT)

A simple Flutter Android app testing deep links,
and communicating with the iHealth CONNECT app.

----

This code is a quick and dirty proof-of-concept.

It has been proven working with the iHealth CONNECT app and a bluetooth blood pressure cuff.

I am making it public because no such example code existed at the time this was written.  I hope it helps you.
